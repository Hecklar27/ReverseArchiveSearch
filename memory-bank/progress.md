## Discord Integration Features 🔗

### Deep Link Implementation
- **Base URL**: `https://discord.com/channels/349201680023289867/349277718954901514/`
- **Dynamic Generation**: Append message ID from JSON data
- **Example**: Message ID `1377373386183016660` → Full URL
- **UI Integration**: Clickable links in search results
- **Error Handling**: Fallback to message ID display if URL generation fails

### User Benefits
- **Direct Navigation**: Jump to original Discord message
- **Full Context**: See reactions, replies, and community discussion  
- **Artist Attribution**: Access to creator and their other works
- **Community Engagement**: Join ongoing conversations about artwork
- **Verification**: Confirm match accuracy at source

## Performance Expectations 📊

### Target Performance by Phase
| Phase | Search Time | Setup Time | Storage | Features |
|-------|-------------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Phase 1** | 30s-2min | None | Minimal | Real-time + Discord links |
| **Phase 2** | 1-5 seconds | 30-120min | ~300MB | Cached + Discord links |
| **Phase 3** | <1 second | 30-60min | ~500MB | FAISS + Discord links |

### Hardware Performance (FAISS + GPU)
- **Optimal Setup**: RTX 3070+ → 10-30 second searches → <1 second with FAISS
- **Recommended**: GTX 1060+ → 30s-2min searches → 1-5 seconds with FAISS  
- **Minimum**: CPU only → 3-10min searches → 5-15 seconds with FAISS

## Technical Dependencies 🔧

### Phase 1 (MVP)
```
torch
torchvision  
clip-by-openai
Pillow
requests
numpy
webbrowser  # For Discord link opening
```

### Phase 2 (Caching)
```
+ pickle/joblib (embedding serialization)
+ sqlite3 (metadata storage)
```

### Phase 3 (FAISS)
```
+ faiss-cpu or faiss-gpu
+ memory profiling tools
```

## Known Issues 🐛
- None yet (pre-implementation)

## Technical Debt 💳
**By Design (MVP)**:
- Single-threaded processing (Phase 1)
- No persistent storage (Phase 1)
- Basic similarity search (Phase 1-2)

**Planned Resolution**:
- Threading for UI responsiveness (Phase 2)
- Persistent embedding cache (Phase 2)
- FAISS optimization (Phase 3)

## Success Metrics by Phase 📈

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- ✅ Real-time search processes 3,300+ messages
- ✅ GPU acceleration functional
- ✅ Clean architecture supporting future enhancements
- ✅ Stable fallback option available
- ✅ **Discord deep links working and clickable**
- ✅ **Users can navigate directly to original messages**

### Phase 2 Success Criteria  
- ✅ 5-10x performance improvement with caching
- ✅ One-time setup completes successfully
